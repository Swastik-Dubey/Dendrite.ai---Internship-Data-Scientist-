# Machine Learning Pipeline Implementation

This repository contains scripts and data files to perform a machine learning pipeline programmatically using the provided JSON file `algoparams_from_ui.json`.

## Files

### `main.py`
This script includes the code for the machine learning pipeline, reading the JSON file, and executing the steps programmatically.

### `algoparams_from_ui.json`
This JSON file contains the machine learning steps in a specific format. The script `main.py` is designed to parse this JSON file and initiate the machine learning pipeline according to the defined steps.

### `your_data.csv`
This file contains the dataset used in the machine learning process. It can be replaced with other datasets following the same structure.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Clone the repository to your local environment.
3. Place your dataset in CSV format in the root directory, named `your_data.csv`.
4. Edit the `algoparams_from_ui.json` file to include your machine learning steps in the defined format.
5. Run the `main.py` script to execute the machine learning pipeline.

```python
python main.py
