## Machine Learning Pipeline Implementation

This repository contains scripts and data files to perform a machine learning pipeline programmatically using the provided JSON file `algoparams_from_ui.json.rtf`.

### Files

- [`main.ipynb`](main.ipynb): This Jupyter Notebook includes the code for the machine learning pipeline, reading the JSON file, and executing the steps programmatically.

- [`algoparams_from_ui.json.rtf`](algoparams_from_ui.json.rtf): This JSON file contains the machine learning steps in a specific format. The Jupyter Notebook `main.ipynb` is designed to parse this JSON file and initiate the machine learning pipeline according to the defined steps.

- [`iris_modified.csv`](iris_modified.csv): This file contains the dataset used in the machine learning process. It can be replaced with other datasets following the same structure.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed.
2. Clone the repository to your local environment.
3. Place your dataset in CSV format in the root directory, named `iris_modified.csv`.
4. Edit the `algoparams_from_ui.json.rtf` file to include your machine learning steps in the defined format.
5. Run the `main.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook to execute the machine learning pipeline.
